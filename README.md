# ChallengeTecnicoVue

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

#IMPORTANT

## First, clone the API (https://github.com/Juanideni/ApiPublication) and Run it!

## Then, you probably have to change the port on this project to connect with API. You can search with CTRL + SHIFT + F in Visual Studio Code and write "localhost". There you can find some examples like this:

## You have to replace that number after "localhost:" and set the port of the url of the API localhost

```sh
